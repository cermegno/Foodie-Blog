# Foodie-Blog
Food blog exercise for the Pied Piper program
## Instructions
- 'init.py' allows you to clean the redis database as you keep progressing through the exercise and modifying the data structures
- 'photo-upload.py' is an example of how to upload photos from the client to the server and from there to ECS
- The different 'step' files progressively solve the problem:
   - Use in conjunction with PPT file for instructions
   - All 'step' files require a 'newmeal.html' file in templates. Rename whichever you need accordingly
- Make sure the 'uploads' folder exists. This is the temporary location for uploaded files
